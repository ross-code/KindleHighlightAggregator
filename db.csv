Book Title,Invent and Wander
Author,"Isaacson, Walter; Bezos, Jeff"
0,"Our vision is to use this platform to build Earth’s most customer- centric company, a place where customers can come to find and discover anything and everything they might want to buy online."
1,"In closing, consider this most important point: the current online shopping experience is the worst it will ever be."
2,"OUCH. IT’S BEEN a brutal year for many in the capital markets and certainly for Amazon.com shareholders. As of this writing, our shares are down more than 80 percent from when I wrote you last year."
3,"Furthermore, we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved and that we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer- facing differentiation to the marketplace."
4,"Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible— one- way doors— and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that— they are changeable, reversible— they’re two- way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups."
5,"Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high- velocity decision making."
6,"First, never use a one- size- fits- all decision- making process."
7,"Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you’re probably being slow."
8,"Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this, but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?”"
9,"Fourth, recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately."
10,"Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you’re going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute. In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient— but it’s also not random. It’s guided— by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it’s worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there. Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries— the “nonlinear” ones— are highly likely to require wandering."
11,"If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle."
12,"I’m always trying to figure out one thing first and foremost: Is this person a missionary or a mercenary? The mercenaries are trying to flip their stock. The missionaries love their product or their service and love their customers, and they’re trying to build a great service. By the way, the great paradox here is that it’s usually the missionaries who make more money, and you can tell really quickly just by talking to people."
13,"Is your work depriving you of energy, or is your work generating energy for you?"
14,"Outsized returns come from betting against conventional wisdom, but conventional wisdom is usually right."
Book Title,The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing
Author,"Ries, Al; Trout, Jack"
0,The basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in.
1,"This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented: How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better."
2,"First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth."
3,You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement.
4,What works in marketing is the same as what works in the military: the unexpected.
5,"Equally as bad as extrapolating a trend is the common practice of assuming the future will be a replay of the present. When you assume that nothing will change, you are predicting the future just as surely as when you assume that something will change. Remember Peter’s Law: The unexpected always happens."
6,"One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping through your category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly if you are to survive in the long term."
7,Ego is the enemy of successful marketing. Objectivity is what’s needed.
8,"Donald Trump and Robert Maxwell are two examples of people blinded by early success and untainted by humility. And when you’re blind, it is indeed hard to focus."
9,"Actually, ego is helpful. It can be an effective driving force in building a business. What hurts is injecting your ego in the marketing process."
10,"When IBM was successful, the company said very little. Now it throws a lot of press conferences. When things are going well, a company doesn’t need the hype. When you need the hype, it usually means you’re in trouble."
